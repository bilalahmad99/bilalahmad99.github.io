## Core Pillars to consider when designing the software architecture

#### Functionality:
The software architecture should provide the necessary functionality to meet the requirements of the system and its users.

#### Scalability:
The architecture should be designed to handle expected and unexpected increases in usage and data volume, making it easy to add more resources and capacity as needed.

#### Performance:
The architecture should be designed to deliver high performance and responsiveness, meeting the needs of the users and the system's performance requirements.

#### Security:
The architecture should be designed to protect against a wide range of security threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system's data and resources.

#### Maintainability:
The architecture should be designed to be easy to maintain, test, and evolve over time, with clear separation of concerns, loose coupling, and well-defined interfaces.

#### Reusability:
The architecture should be designed to be reusable, making it easy to reuse components and patterns across different parts of the system and different projects, reducing the overall development effort and costs.

#### Flexibility:
The architecture should be designed to be flexible and adaptable, able to handle changes in requirements, technologies, and environments over time.
