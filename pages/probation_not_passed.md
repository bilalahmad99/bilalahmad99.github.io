## The Hardest Conversation: Letting Go of a Team Member

There's no easy way to tell someone they're leaving the team. Whether it's the end of a probation period, a role that's no longer needed, or a decision that things aren't working out—this is one of those moments in management that nobody prepares you for, and it stays with you long after the conversation ends.

As a manager, you carry the weight of knowing you're about to change someone's life, their financial security, and potentially their confidence in ways that might take months or years to recover from.

### The Weight of the Decision

Before you even schedule the meeting, you've likely spent weeks (or months) documenting concerns, having difficult conversations, providing feedback, and hoping things would turn around. You've probably lost sleep over it, questioned your own judgment, and wondered if you could have done more.

The truth is, if you're a decent manager, you've already tried. You've given clear feedback, provided resources, adjusted expectations, and offered support. But sometimes, despite everyone's best efforts, it just doesn't work out. The role isn't right, the skills gap is too wide, or the cultural fit isn't there. And that's okay—it doesn't make you a bad person, and it doesn't make them a bad person either.

---

### Preparing for the Conversation

#### 1. Be Clear and Direct, But Kind

There's no way to sugarcoat this. Being vague or trying to soften the blow with corporate jargon only makes it worse. The person deserves clarity. They need to understand:
- What the decision is (that their employment is ending)
- When their last day will be
- What happens next (notice period, exit process, references)
- Why this decision was made (be specific but not cruel)

#### 2. Have Everything Ready

Before the meeting, make sure you have:
- Written documentation of the decision (HR will need this)
- Details about notice period, final pay, benefits
- Information about any support available (outplacement, references)
- Answers to questions they might ask

Don't make them wait for details or chase you for information afterward. They're already dealing with enough.

#### 3. Choose the Right Time and Place

This conversation deserves privacy and respect. Not over Slack. Not in an open office. Not on a Friday afternoon when they're about to go home for the weekend. Schedule it early in the week, in a private space, and give them time to process afterward.

### During the Conversation

#### Start with the Decision

Don't build up to it with small talk or pleasantries. They'll know something is wrong, and the anxiety will be unbearable. Start with something like:

"I asked you here today because I need to share a difficult decision. After careful consideration, we've decided that we need to part ways—your last day will be [date]. I want to talk you through what happens next and answer any questions you have."

Then pause. Let them process. They might cry. They might get angry. They might go quiet. All of these reactions are valid. Give them space.

#### Be Specific, But Not Cruel

They deserve to know why. But frame it constructively:

- "The role requires stronger experience in [specific area], and despite the support we've provided, we haven't seen the progress we need."
- "The technical skills required for this position are different from what we initially discussed, and the gap is wider than we can bridge."
- "The pace and complexity of this environment requires someone with more experience in [specific context]."

Avoid personal attacks. Focus on the role fit, not their character. This isn't about them being "bad"—it's about the role not being right for them at this stage of their career.

#### Listen

After you've shared the decision, listen. They might have questions. They might want to understand what went wrong. They might need to express frustration or disappointment. Let them. This isn't about defending your decision—it's about giving them closure.

#### Offer Support

If you can, offer:
- A reference letter (be honest but fair)
- Help with their job search
- Connections in your network
- Honest feedback about what they could work on for future roles

You don't have to do this, but if you can, it helps. Remember, this person is about to go back into the job market. A little support can make a huge difference.

### After the Conversation

#### Follow Up in Writing

Send a follow-up email confirming:
- The decision
- Their last day
- Next steps
- Who they can contact with questions

This gives them something concrete to refer back to and ensures there's no confusion.

#### Take Care of Yourself

This conversation will affect you too. You might feel guilty, sad, or relieved—all of these emotions are normal. Talk to someone you trust. Process what happened. Reflect on what you learned. And remember: making the right decision for the team and the company doesn't make you a bad person.

#### Learn from It

Every difficult conversation is a learning opportunity. Ask yourself:
- Could I have identified this earlier?
- Was my feedback clear enough?
- Did I provide adequate support?
- What would I do differently next time?

Use this to become a better manager. But don't beat yourself up. Sometimes, despite everyone's best efforts, things just don't work out.

### What I've Learned

Over the years, I've learned a few things about these conversations:

**It never gets easier.** Anyone who tells you it does is lying or has become desensitized. If you're human, telling someone they're losing their job will always be hard.

**Being kind doesn't mean being weak.** You can be direct, clear, and firm while still being empathetic. In fact, clarity is a form of kindness—it respects their intelligence and gives them what they need to move forward.

**The way you handle this matters.** Years later, people remember how you treated them during difficult times. Handle it with dignity and respect, and you'll have no regrets.

**It's okay to feel conflicted.** You can believe this is the right decision for the team while still feeling sad about it. These aren't mutually exclusive emotions.

### A Note to Those on the Other Side

If you're reading this and you've been on the receiving end of this conversation, I'm sorry. I know how much it hurts. But please know:

- This doesn't define your worth as a person or a professional.
- Sometimes roles just don't fit, and that's okay.
- Use the feedback constructively, but don't let it destroy your confidence.
- The right role is out there—this one just wasn't it.
- Most managers who have this conversation genuinely wish things had worked out differently.

### Final Thoughts

Managing people means making difficult decisions. Letting someone go is one of the hardest, but sometimes it's necessary. When you have to do it, do it with clarity, kindness, and respect. Be human. Remember that on the other side of that conversation is a person with hopes, bills, and dreams—just like you.

And if you're the one delivering this news, know that doing it well—with honesty, empathy, and dignity—is one of the most important things you'll do as a manager. It won't make it easy, but it will make it right.
