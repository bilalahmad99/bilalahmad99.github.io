<br>
<p>I’m passionate about solving complex problems, just like every engineer. My career began as a software developer, and over the years, I transitioned into platform and infrastructure engineering, with a particular focus on Site Reliability.
</p>
<p>
Originally from Pakistan, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with talented individuals and work in dynamic cities like Berlin, San Jose, Dubai, Islamabad, and London. These diverse experiences in the tech industry have not only shaped my professional growth but also enriched me personally.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not debugging production issues or designing resilient systems, you'll find me writing about my experiments and learnings here. I'm particularly interested in observability, GitOps, Kubernetes, and making infrastructure as code more maintainable. Currently exploring how AI tools like Amazon Q CLI can supercharge developer productivity.

<strong>Currently:</strong> Building reliable platforms at McLaren Applied | Writing about Grafana OSS, AWS, and Kubernetes | Experimenting with MCP servers and AI-assisted workflows
