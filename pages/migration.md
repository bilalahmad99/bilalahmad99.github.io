## Cloud Migrations

There are several types of cloud migrations that organizations can undertake, depending on their needs and resources. Some common types of cloud migrations include:

##### Lift and shift:

This type of migration involves moving existing on-premises applications and infrastructure to the cloud without making any major changes. This approach is often used for simple and non-critical applications.

##### Re-platforming:

This type of migration involves making changes to the application or infrastructure to take advantage of the cloud's capabilities. This can include refactoring the application to use cloud-native services or changing the infrastructure to use cloud-based storage and networking.

##### Refactoring:

This type of migration involves re-architecting the application to take advantage of cloud-native services and best practices. This can include breaking the application into smaller microservices or using a cloud-native database.

##### Cloud-native:
This type of migration involves building new applications or services that are designed to run natively in the cloud. This approach requires a significant investment in time and resources to design and build new applications, but it can provide the most benefits in terms of scalability and cost-efficiency.

##### Hybrid:

This type of migration involves maintaining some on-premises infrastructure and moving some of the workloads to the cloud. This approach allows organizations to take advantage of the cloud's capabilities while still maintaining some control over the infrastructure and data.

##### Multi-cloud:

This type of migration involves using multiple cloud providers for different services or workloads, depending on the specific requirements of the application or service. This approach allows organizations to take advantage of the strengths of different cloud providers and to minimize vendor lock-in.

#### Some Positive and Negative Impacts to consider:

##### Pros

* Optimized Cost â€“ You only pay for what you use
* Managed Services - Patching, upgrades, availability etc are managed by provider 
* Auto-Scaling - Services can scale automatically based on demand
* Monitoring - Integrated within the provider
* Control - You can choose the level of control that you want using IaaS & PaaS
* Empowerment - Dev Teams can now potentially own their services all the way into production

##### Cons

* Up-skilling - Ops & Dev functions need to learn new provider
* Processes - Business practices & structures may have to change or adapt to better support Cloud e.g. on-call rota etc
* Refactoring - Applications & services may need to be refactored to make better use of modern architectural patterns
* Downtime - Downtime for migration might be an issue


### Migration Strategy

A well-defined cloud migration strategy can help organizations realize the benefits of cloud computing, such as increased scalability, cost-efficiency, and security.

Here are some general steps that organizations can follow when creating a cloud migration strategy:

##### Assessment:
Understand the current state of the organization's IT environment, including the applications, data, and infrastructure that will need to be migrated. Identify the business objectives and goals for the migration.

##### Planning:
Identify the specific steps that need to be taken to migrate the organization's IT environment to the cloud. Define the migration timeline, resources required, and any risks or dependencies.

##### Migration:
Execute the migration plan, moving applications, data, and infrastructure to the cloud. Test and validate the migration to ensure that everything is working correctly.

##### Optimization:
Continuously monitor and optimize the cloud environment to ensure that it is meeting the organization's business objectives and goals.

##### Security and Compliance:
Establish security and compliance controls for the cloud environment, including access controls, data encryption, and incident management.

##### Continual improvement:
Continuously evaluate and improve the cloud environment to ensure that it remains aligned with the organization's business objectives and goals.
