## 5 common mistakes when setting up Istio

Istio is an open-source service mesh that can be used to manage and control the traffic within a microservices-based application. Setting up Istio can be complex, and it's important to avoid common mistakes in order to ensure that the service mesh is functioning correctly. Here are five common mistakes that organizations make when setting up Istio:

#### Not properly configuring the sidecar proxies:
Istio uses sidecar proxies to manage and control traffic within the service mesh. It's important to ensure that the proxies are properly configured and that they have the correct configuration for the specific environment.

#### Not properly configuring security:
Istio provides a number of security features, such as mutual TLS and JWT-based authentication. It's important to ensure that these features are properly configured to protect the service mesh from unauthorized access.

#### Not properly configuring traffic routing:
Istio provides a number of traffic routing options, such as traffic shifting and traffic mirroring. It's important to ensure that the correct routing options are being used and that the traffic is being directed to the correct services.

#### Not properly configuring monitoring and logging:
Istio provides a number of monitoring and logging options. It's important to ensure that the correct options are being used and that they are properly configured to provide visibility into the service mesh.

#### Not properly testing:
Istio is a complex system and it's important to thoroughly test it to ensure that it is functioning correctly. This includes testing the different features of the service mesh and ensuring that they are working correctly in the specific environment.
